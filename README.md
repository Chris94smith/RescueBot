# Rescue Bot

## Description
Final project developed as a group for my CPRE 288 Embedded Systems class.  This code was developed to run on ISU's cybots.  
The purpose of this code is to navigate the cybot through an obstacle course and locate its objective using only the built-in dropoff sensors and collision bumpers 
along with a top mounted IR and sonar ping sensor.  The program can be run manually using either PUTTY or the included Python UI.  The program can also be run autonomously.
